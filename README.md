# Multiprocessing demo in R

This is a little demo I made for an [Rladies meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/events/259965943/). 

As a newbie to R I thought it would be useful to share a couple of things I learnt after I had a rather slow interaction on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53473059/iterating-through-a-list-of-parameters-using-tidyquant-r/53490444#53490444).

From the experience and perspective of a scientist (meaning this is not going to be a perfect software engineering setup) 
it shows how to setup a good work environment in R and how to execute parallel processing.

Enjoy!
